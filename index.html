    <h1>Priority Queues</h1>
    <p>
      A Priority Queue is a type of data structure in which each element has an
      associated priority, and wlements with higher priority are served before
      elemnets with lower priority. Unlike a regular queue or stack, where
      elements are processed in a strictly first-in-first-out or
      last-in-first-out manner, a priority queue follows a more flexible
      ordering based on priorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The essentioal operations supported by a priority queue include inserting
      an element with a specified priority, and removing or extracting the
      element with the highest priority. Priority queues are often implemented
      using various data structures, such as binary heaps, Finonacci heaps, or
      self-balancing binary search trees.
